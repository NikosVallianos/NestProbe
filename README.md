# NestProbe
NestProbe is a family of small electronic devices developed by Wildlife Sense to
record and, for some planned models, transmit environmental parameters relevant
to sea turtle nests. The data are used to study correlations between these
parameters and the outcome of the nests, and to enable timely and appropriate
conservation actions when necessary.

## Current models
