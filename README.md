# NestProbe
NestProbe is a family of electronic instruments developed by Wildlife Sense to
record and, for some planned models, transmit environmental parameters relevant
to sea turtle nests. The data are used to study correlations between these
parameters and their effects on the outcome of the nests, and to enable timely
and appropriate conservation actions when necessary.

## Current models
